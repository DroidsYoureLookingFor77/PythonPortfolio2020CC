This Python program is a Mad Lib, which is a word puzzle of sorts that involves plugging random words into a prewritten paragraph in 
specific sections to make a hilarious story. This particular Mad Lib is based on Boromir's "One does not simply walk into Mordor" line from the
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.
